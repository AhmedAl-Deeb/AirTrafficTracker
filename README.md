# Air Traffic Tracker (ATT)

**Track flights live, anywhere around the world with precision and elegance.**

## Description

This project powers **Air Traffic Tracker (ATT)**, a sleek, real‑time flight tracking web app available at [https://attracker.live](https://attracker.live). Users can search and explore live flight information, aircraft details and airline data giving an interactive view of global air traffic.

Built with a focus on performance, clarity and modern UX, ATT aims to deliver:

* Real‑time flight data (departure, arrival, status)
* Global map visualization of flights and aircraft
* Filtering by airline, airplane type and other attributes
* Clean, responsive UI for desktop and mobile

## Features

* Live search and detailed view of individual flights
* Browse by airlines and aircraft types
* Global coverage via aggregated data feeds
* Intuitive map interface plus list/details views
* Modular, maintainable architecture ready for enhancement

## Tech Stack

* Front‑end: HTML5, CSS3, modern JavaScript (ES6+)
* Mapping / visualization: [your map library name] (replace with actual)
* Back‑end / data: Real‑time flights API(s) + web service layer
* Deployment: Cloud‑hosted (optionally) + CDN for assets

## Project Goals

* Deliver a high‑quality, real‑time experience for aviation enthusiasts, travellers and developers alike
* Provide a clean codebase that’s easy to extend. e.g., add new data sources, refine filters, improve UX
* Offer an open‑source foundation for learning about real‑time data ingestion, mapping and aviation workflows
